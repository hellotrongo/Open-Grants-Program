## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

The goal of Parami Protocol is to build a blockchain-empowered fair and transparent win-win private domain traffic advertising alliance, connecting the majority of advertisers, traffic owners and users, removing intermediaries, improving settlement efficiency, allowing users to take back their own digital sovereignty, and the revenue of all parties involved in digital advertising.

Parami uses Substrate as the blockchain development framework, mainly for two reasons. From the technical level, Substrate framework is a general blockchain development framework launched by Polkadot. Substrate contains all the components needed to build a blockchain, including a p2p network, consensus mechanism, distributed database, transaction queue, and core runtime. The modulized framework provides a powerful tool for chain or side-chain development.

On an ecological basis, the number of Polkadot developers and projects is growing at a rapid pace. The Web3 Foundation currently funds over 100 projects, most of which are related to Polkadot or Substrate. In terms of eco-applications, there are already nearly 100 projects based on Substrate. More and more talented developers and teams are joining the Polkadot ecosystem. These Web3.0 projects will all have the need for tokenized marketing, thus becoming an important business partner of Parami.

The Parami protocol will provide a DID-based tokenized advertising preference solution for the whole Polkadot ecosystem, with its power of the parachain & relay-chain mechanism.

We have done many attempts to combine blockchain with digital advertising, and have been bothered by traditional digital advertising. We have been keeping considering some questions:

- How can users benefit from the advertising industry?
- How can users re-gain their control of self digital sovereignty, and be freedom from digital exploitation?
- How can participants in the digital advertising industry can mutually benefit from each other?

So we come up with the Parami Protocol, an identity-driven and data-driven solution to digitial advertising.

From the perspective of the advertising industry, the blockchain technology can get fairness and autonomy. On the other hand, from the blockchain's view, tokenized advertising can bring more opportunities and value growth to the web 3.0 ecosystem.

### Project Details


The main participants of the Parami protocol are advertisers and users. The full set of services is achieved through the cooperation of multiple components.

![Project Details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72891/104114587-1aa60680-5341-11eb-9584-79ab45d8b932.png)

Parami components include Runtime, Off-chain worker, Access Services, Advertiser Portal, and Background Services.
Runtime and Off-chain workers work together to implement the factor core of Parami.

Advertisers can create ad requests by accessing the Access Services through the Advertiser Portal.

Users access various types of ads through different ad media. Parami uses CDN and API Gateway to speed up user access.
It also provides full Firewall and Auth support to enhance the security of the whole access system.

To support the full core service, we use IPFS and RDS as the storage layer, and use Message Queue to improve the message processing performance.

#### Data Analysis Platform

Advertisers are always very concerned about the effectiveness of advertising. For this reason, we will develop a data analysis platform to facilitate advertisers to do further analysis of placement data and improve the effectiveness of advertising.

### Ecosystem Fit

The Polkadot community alreay has a few standard DID solutions. The Parami DID will be a production-ready and domain-specific DID solution. We will add a referral system and use DID attributes as users' ad preference data.

Projects like XCHNG, MAD Network, ADEX and Parpuys, use smart contracts to build infrastructure, which is expensive for normal users yet not appealing.

Other projects, like Rebelai, adChain, are using blockchain to solve the problem of deception in traditional advertising, which neglects the value of user data and privacy.

Parami combines DID with tokenized advertising, providing an Ad 3.0 paradigm to Web 3.0, decentralized privacy and data security, benefiting all participants.

| 2. | Substrate module: ads | We will create a Substrate module that will manage ads metadata, including traditional ads metadata and rewarding settings |
| 3. | Substrate module: prices | We will create a Substrate module that will act as the price oracle to provide real-world prices of different kinds of assets |
| 4. | Substrate chain | All above modules of our custom chain will interact to provide a useable Ad platform. There will be APIs to setup DIDs and ads and APIs that allow transfer assets via DID |

| 7. | Social Integration | We will integrate ads to some social platforms like WeChat, allowing ad viewers to be verified as DID owners and gain rewards. To enable the combination of Wallet App and social platforms, we will rely on the open platform functionality provided by social platforms, such as [WeChat MiniProgram](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/wx), Facebook APIs, and Telegram Bots. |

## Future Plans

We will continue to build a more decentralized Ad platform for the Polkadot ecosystem.

- Refine oracle implementation. Engage ad-specific validation into it, like an anti-spam check, visibility validation, and so on.
- Introduce offchain-worker to verify ads and rewards
- Introduce chain governance logic to setup a more decentralized platform
- Introduce NFT support for advertisers, allowing issuing coupons, vouchers, tickets, etc
- Introduce a Zero Knowledge Proof based data module, enhancing data privacy
